## ✨ Features

### 🖐️ Real-Time Static Gesture Detection

* Detects hand gestures from live webcam input
* Supports ASL (American Sign Language) or custom gesture datasets

### 🔤 Alphabet & Word Translation

* Converts hand gestures to English letters
* Displays predicted words/phrases for seamless understanding

### 📸 Webcam Support

* Works with internal or external webcams
* Frame-by-frame prediction using OpenCV

### 🧠 Machine Learning Models

* Support for:

  * CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
  * Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2 / ResNet
  * Custom-trained models with high accuracy

### 🎨 User Interface (Optional)

* Streamlit or Gradio-based UI
* Live camera feed, prediction output, and confidence levels
* Toggle between model modes and switch camera inputs

## 💻 System Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* Webcam
* TensorFlow/Keras compatible GPU (optional for faster inference)

---

## 📚 Libraries Used

* **OpenCV** – for video stream handling
* **MediaPipe** (optional) – for enhanced hand landmark detection
* **NumPy** – for data manipulation
* **TensorFlow / Keras** – for training and inference
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for visualization
* **Streamlit / Gradio** – for interactive web UI

---

## 📂 Dataset

* ASL Alphabet Dataset (Kaggle or custom captured)
* Images labeled A-Z with hand gesture samples
* Preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, augmentation

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sign-language-recognition.git
cd sign-language-recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py  # or streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🛠️ Customization

* Add new gesture classes to expand vocabulary
* Train model on new languages or regional signs
* Integrate audio/text output for better communication aid
